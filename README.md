# Mental Math Aquarium - Web Version :computer: :repeat: :tropical_fish:

This game is designed to help train your mental math skills in a fun aquatic environment.

## Getting Started

To run the game [click here](https://alexchivvy.github.io/mental-math-aquarium/). You will open the game page with brief instructions for play.

:warning: The game is not compatible with mobile. You have to run in a browser on your notebook or desktop PC.

## How to play

To start the game click on the button "Play". You begin the game with 1 fishy and unlimited mental math questions, each with an initial timer of 10 seconds. 

The time you take to answer each question is converted into credits, which can be used to either buy additional fishies or feed your current tank. 

When your current fishies are hungry, they will turn green and slow down. Feed them quickly before they disappear!
